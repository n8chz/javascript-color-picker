javascript-color-picker
=======================

Interactive color picker in one 9111-byte file (HTML/CSS/JavaScript)

Selected color is at clicked location in a square that is a cross-sectional slice of the color cube for your choice of RGB or HSL.
One of the three channels (of your choice) is selected with a slider, and the other two are the coordinates of the selected point in the square.

An installed demo is at http://voodothosting.com/23/sandbox/picker2.html
